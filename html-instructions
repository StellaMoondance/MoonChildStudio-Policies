# Moon Child Studio Policies  

## Commitment to Excellence  
At Moon Child Studio, we are dedicated to providing a seamless and professional experience for all clients. Our policies are designed to ensure clarity, fairness, and the highest level of service. Please review the following terms before booking your session.  

---

## Booking & Payments  

### [Passport & ID Photo Bookings](#passport-id-photo-bookings)  
- Payment for passport and ID photo sessions is **due in full at the time of booking**.  
- **No refunds will be issued for cancellations or no-shows.**  
- Clients may **reschedule one time only** up to **24 hours before the session**. Payment will be credited toward the new date.  
- If a second reschedule is required, the session will be **automatically cancelled without refund**, and a new time slot must be purchased.  
- **No-shows are automatically cancelled without refund.** This policy is necessary to ensure fairness to other clients and to compensate for the time and resources reserved for the session. As a small business, our schedule must be respected to maintain quality service for all clients.  

### [Portrait, Fine Art & Event Bookings](#portrait-fine-art-event-bookings)  
- A **50% non-refundable retainer** is required to secure your session date.  
- The remaining balance must be paid before or on the session day.  
- **Online bookings operate on a first-come, first-served basis.** A booking is not confirmed until the deposit or reservation fee is paid.  
- **Unpaid deposits or reservation fees will result in automatic session cancellation after 24 hours.**  
- Please follow all booking instructions carefully. **Incomplete bookings will not be added to our calendar, and the date will remain available for other clients.**  
- **One reschedule is permitted per booking** for portrait, fine art, or event sessions. Rescheduling must be requested at least **48 hours before the session**.
